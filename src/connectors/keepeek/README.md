- **Token Endpoint**: Developer-oriented settings available in **Keepeek** documentation. These settings depends on each **Keepeek** clients (e.g., https://auth.keepeek.com/auth/realms/{env-name}/protocol/openid-connect/token)

### Server Authentication

The credentials used for machine-to-machine authentication determine the governance on assets in automation workflows. 

This means that if the credentials restrict access to specific assets, only those assets will be available during batch processing.

### Browser Authentication or Impersonation

GraFx Studio accesses assets available in your Media Provider via impersonation, where the credentials configured for the connector determine which assets are visible to the user in the template.

**Impersonation** is the process of granting GraFx Studio users access to the DAM system using pre-configured credentials. This ensures seamless integration while respecting the DAM's security and governance rules.

## Using Assets from Your **Keepeek** System

### Place Assets in Your Template

- Select the **Keepeek** Connector.

- **Keepeek** assets behave like any other asset in GraFx Studio.

### Image Variables
